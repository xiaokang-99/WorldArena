## Overview

WorldArena is a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both **perceptual** and **functional** dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through **(1) video perception quality**, measured with sixteen metrics across six sub-dimensions; **(2) embodied task functionality**, which evaluates world models as synthetic data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners; **(3) human evaluations**, including overall quality, physics adherence, instruction following and head-to-head win rate. Furthermore, we propose **EWMScore**, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. This work provides a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.
