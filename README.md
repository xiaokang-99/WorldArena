## 🔍 Overview

WorldArena is a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both **perceptual** and **functional** dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through **(1) video perception quality**, measured with sixteen metrics across six sub-dimensions; **(2) embodied task functionality**, which evaluates world models as synthetic data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners; **(3) human evaluations**, including overall quality, physics adherence, instruction following and head-to-head win rate. Furthermore, we propose **EWMScore**, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. This work provides a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.

## 🏆 Leaderboard

The official WorldArena leaderboard is hosted on Hugging Face: [![Leaderboard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Leaderboard-HuggingFace-2D2D2D?style=flat&logo=huggingface&logoColor=ffcc00)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/WorldArena/WorldArena). It provides standardized evaluation results across video perception quality, embodied task functionality, and the unified EWMScore. We welcome community submissions to benchmark new embodied world models under a fair and reproducible protocol. Join us in advancing truly functional world models for embodied AI.
